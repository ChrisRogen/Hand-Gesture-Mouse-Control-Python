Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse using Python

This Python script allows you to control your computer's mouse using hand gestures captured from your webcam. It's a fun and interactive way to navigate your computer without touching the mouse!

Features:

Real-time Hand Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and track your hand in real-time.
Gesture Recognition: Recognizes various hand gestures, allowing you to perform actions like moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.
Simple and Intuitive: Easy-to-understand codebase with clear comments for each step of the process.
Customizable: Adapt the code to recognize additional gestures or tailor it to your specific needs.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
PyAutoGUI
Usage:

Install the required libraries using pip.
Run the script.
Hold your hand in front of the webcam and perform gestures to control the mouse.
Example Gesture Controls:

Move Cursor: Move your hand to move the cursor on the screen.
Click: Perform a specific gesture to simulate a mouse click.
Scroll: Use a different gesture to simulate scrolling up or down.
